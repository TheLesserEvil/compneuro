Explanation of steps:
(1) and (2) are the partial derivatives of the error function E=ax^2+ay^2
(3) is empty line
(4) to (9) are also explained between eq 58-59 in handouts
  (4) gradient descent rule
  (5) apply gradient descent rule
  (6) expand xi to isolate the learning rate
  (7) algebra
  (8) collapse to previous gradient
  (9) self explanatory
(10) learning must be positive because this is how we have a downward direction towards a minimum.
---> (11)divergence from picture.
------> to get rid of absolute values, there exist 2 cases: 
          case 1: different signs -> gonna recover the proper result
          case 2: same signs -> gonna obtain rate = 0, trivial case
